There are many students who struggle with balancing their workload and keeping organised. This application aims to provide a system to help students manage their time effectively.

## Wireframes

## Colour Palette
I selected the following colour palette to be evocative of a desktop daily planner. The muted browns are sharply contrasted by the bright highlights.

## Accessability
TBC

## Legal Considerations
- The application is not a paid service and does not sell products.

## Evaluation
- I struggled during the design phase
- Justify decision to develop mobile first
- The website requires a better way of implementing resusable components such as the header and footer
